/**
 *

 Write a program to calculate the MPG for a car journey.
 (MPG = Miles per gallon, calculate by dividing number of miles, by number of gallons of gas used).

 Write a method called mpg that has two arguments, in the following order:
 - a double to represent the number of miles driven, and
 - a double to represent the number of gallons of gas used on a car journey
 And returns a double value, representing the MPG for the journey.

 Your method should calculate and return the MPG for the car journey.  Your main method should
 -	Ask the user for the miles and gas used
 -	Call your method
 -	Use the returned value to display the MPG

        // TODO Here, call the mpg method and save the returned MPG value

        // TODO Print the return value.

    // TODO create a public method called "mpg".
    // A public method declaration begins with the word public, for example in the calculate() method above.
    // The method needs to be public so the test can find it.
    // Make sure you use the name mpg since the test expects to find a method with that name.
    // The method takes two arguments, miles driven and gas used, in that order.
    // It will calculate and return the MPG for this journey.
